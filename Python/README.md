## Python 3 projects:
#### :octocat: **Epubify:** 
Convert Articles to .epub format and automatically save them to Dropbox. 
The idea was to be able to read articles which I'd normally save in "Pocket" on my regular
ebook reader. 
__Using packages:__
- dropbox
- pocket
- BeautifulSoup

#### :octocat: **Twitter spark app:** 
PySpark application, fully OOP, using Twitter data (in dutch), to be reworked with recent twitter data ini English, soon.
OOP project, which fetches information from the tweets and can output trends in twitter between topics. 
Can be extended in order to do other cool stuff from twitter data like ML and statistics 
__Using packages:__
- pySpark
- sparkML
- tweepy (for automatic fetching of data) - the complete implementation is not working yet.

#### :octocat: **Youtuber:** 
Application whose intent is to get a URL of a youtube playlist and then download all the tracks from there as MP3 format, with highes possible quality available, in order for the user to listen offline. 
This project is not yet implemented. 
#TODO

#### :octocat: **Covid-hack-the-crisis:**
Project on which I will work soon, the idea is to be able to fetch data for sick of Covid-19 people and get their location (assuming they agree, but for this project i will use fake data), and then let everyone who's been in contact with A sick person, know to keep an eye on their health condition.
